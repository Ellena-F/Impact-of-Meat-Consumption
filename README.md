# Impact of Meat Consumption

Meat consumption has grown rapidly over the past 50 years, from 71 million tonnes in 1961
to 318 million tonnes in 2014 globally, which is almost a 450% growth.
At the same time, global climate change is worsening each year since 1951, with the
increasing carbon dioxide level and global land-ocean temperature. Moreover,
according to World Health Organization, there is a
globally increasing trend of chronic diseases that is related to diet and nutrition, such as
cardiovascular diseases (heart attack, stroke) and cancer. Therefore, in order to determine the
solutions for these issues we will first have to identify the main cause for these problems. In
this project, it will explore the relationship between the level of meat consumption and
how it influences global climate change and human health. 


This project will first use a shiny dashboard to demonstrate how the increasing of diet related chronic
disease may linked to the level of meat consumption, by examining the change in meat
consumption level over the years and these diseases rate from different countries. Then, it will be illustrating
how the increasing of consumption of meat may lead to a worsening climate problem, by exploring greenhouse gases produced, 
waste produced, and land used from meat production.

## Conclusion
In summary, several researches have stated that meat consumption level plays an important
role in our health, we also found out that there is a positive correlation between meat
consumption level and diet related chronic diseases. However, correlation does not equal to
causation, we do not have enough evidence to show that there is a direct link between the
level of meat consumption and the number of people who diagnosed with diet related chronic
diseases. On the other hand, the level of meat consumption is definitely a huge contributor to
the global climate change. As it is the main contributor to greenhouse gases such as carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Also, animal agriculture produces an enormous amount
of waste every single day; alone in United States, waste produced by animal agriculture
sector each year can cover up the entire Victoria state, Sydney and Brisbane. Moreover,
waste is also responsible for nitrous oxide emission. Furthermore, animal agriculture also
causes serious deforestation issue around the globe, especially for Amazon rainforest area.
67.5% of Amazon deforestation is caused directly by animal agriculture and 29% is caused
by agriculture activities. In conclusion, the spike of animal consumption level over the years
are influencing not only our, but also the health of the earth. The solution for these problems
is to simply lower the consumption level of meat or any types of animal products. In turns, it
will not only improve our health, the natural ecosystems, but also a better future for the next
generations.
